#bookTracker
A full-stack webapp which helps its users discover, store, and organize books. (Still in development)

As someone who enjoys reading and likes to stay organized, I decided to turn one of my favourite hobbies into a project and show the skills I've accuired on my programing journey and further develop said skills.

##BookTracker offers the user to:
-View a list of books stored in the database;
-Add new books manually via API or a form;
-Automatically fetch and seed books from the Google Books API
-Store data persistently using PostgreSQL
-Fast backend powered by FastAPI
-Organized structure using SQLAlchemy ORM
-CORS-enabled API for frontend integration
-Modern and responsive React (Vite) frontend
